Description:
We humans can easily recognize relations between data from different domains without any supervision, but to do it automatically is very challenging, it requires many ground-truth pairs that illustrate the relations. Generative adversarial networks is one that learns to discover relations between different domains (DiscoGAN).Using the discovered relations, we are trying to successfully transfer the style from one domain to another while preserving key attributes such as orientation and face identity.

Note : Data set has been generated using gaussian misture model. It can be scaled to any level as per user need.

Output : It is available in separate folder.
